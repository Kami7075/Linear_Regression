Linear Regression Project

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression to understand relationships between variables and predict continuous outcomes. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used extensively in data science for predictive modeling.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for linear regression analysis.
Model Training: Applied linear regression, analyzing coefficients to understand variable relationships.
Evaluation: Used metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error to assess model performance.
Requirements
Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, Pandas.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb to train and test the model.
